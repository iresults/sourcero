Demo: [Darkstrap vs. Bootstrap][demo]

# Darkstrap (v0.9.2)

Made by [danneu](http://danneu.com).

A dark theme for Twitter Bootstrap 2.
    
## Usage

* Download `darkstrap.css`
* Place it in your stylesheet directory
* Include it after you load `bootstrap.css`

    <head>
      <link href='stylesheets/bootstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' />
      <link href='stylesheets/darkstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' />
    </head>
    
## Ideas behind the design

1. Invert the colors of Twitter Bootstrap.

2. Make `.well` look awesome.

3. Integrate the darkstrap `.well` into other components.

## Requests/Issues/Suggestions/Feedback

I'm always open to feedback and ideas.

I'm not a designer and I didn't do much testing on anything other than my screen with my eyes.

Since I don't actually use Darkstrap in a project of my own anymore, I'm open to suggestions from the people that do.

Feel free to create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap/issues) or just [email me](mailto:danrodneu@gmail.com).
